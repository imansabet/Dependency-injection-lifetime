# Dependency Injection Lifetime

This repository contains an example of how to use dependency injection with different lifetime options in C#.

## Overview

Dependency injection is a design pattern that allows the removal of hard-coded dependencies and makes it possible to change them, whether at run-time or compile-time. In this example, we explore how to use dependency injection with different lifetime options, such as transient, scoped, and singleton.

## Getting Started

To get started with this example, simply clone the repository to your local machine and open the solution in Visual Studio or any other C# IDE. You can then explore the different classes and interfaces to understand how dependency injection is implemented with different lifetime options.

## Usage

The main focus of this example is to demonstrate how to use dependency injection with different lifetime options. You can explore the code to see how the dependencies are registered and injected using the built-in dependency injection container in .NET.
